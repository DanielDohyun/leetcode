In a Kubernetes cluster, services in one microservice can communicate with other services by using the service name as a DNS. If you expose your microservices using Kubernetes Service objects, the DNS for a service is typically <service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local. If you're using the default namespace, you can generally just use <service-name> as the hostname.

Here's how you can write a Python program in Microservice A to call a POST API in Microservice B:

First, install the requests library which makes it easier to make HTTP requests:
```bash
pip install requests
```
Now, write the Python program:
```python
import requests

def call_microservice_b():
    # The URL should be of the form "http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local/<api-path>"
    # Assuming the service name of Microservice B is "microservice-b" and it's in the "default" namespace
    url = "http://microservice-b/api-endpoint"  # Replace "api-endpoint" with your actual endpoint

    # Your POST data
    data = {
        "key": "value"
    }

    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)

    # Handling the response
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Success:", response.json())
    else:
        print("Error:", response.text)

call_microservice_b()
```
Replace the placeholders with your actual service names, namespaces, and API endpoints. Also, make sure that the necessary network policies and permissions are set in the Kubernetes cluster to allow communication between the microservices.

Make sure Microservice B has a Kubernetes Service associated with it, which allows it to be accessible from other pods in the cluster.
